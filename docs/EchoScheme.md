# EchoScheme

This service "echoes" its arguments.

It is part of our [Opencog Services](opencog-services-repo).

### Welcome

The service expects 0 to n arguments (n is limited as described [here](general-guide)) and simply outputs a list of them in [Scheme](scheme) syntax.

### Whatâ€™s the point?

The service is meant to illustrate the implementation of a Scheme Opencog service.

### How does it work?

You can use this service from [SingularityNET DApp](dap), clicking on `SNET/Opencog`.

You can also call the service from SingularityNET CLI (`snet`):

```
$ snet set current_agent_at YOUR_AGENT_ADDRESS
set current_agent_at YOUR_AGENT_ADDRESS

$ snet client call execute EchoScheme 1 2
```

It can also be executed as an asynchronous task:

```
$ snet set current_agent_at YOUR_AGENT_ADDRESS
set current_agent_at YOUR_AGENT_ADDRESS

$ snet client call asynchronousTask Echo 1 2
```

In this case the command output is an URL where you can find the results as soon as they are available.
